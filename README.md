# DimensionChipResetter

An arduino-only tool for resetting Dimension 3D Printer filament cartridges.

Based on this GUI: https://github.com/slaytonrnd/CartridgeWriter and probably this Arduino code: https://github.com/meawoppl/eepromTool-ds2433

## Ideal Features
  * Auto-detect printer type?
  * Keep all settings the same except for serial number (randomize it) and filament amount (set to initial amount)

## Testing
  * Ensure it reproduces the same binary as CartridgeWriter above
